<h1>CSS Tutorial - Internal CSS</h1>

	<p>Hai. Asslamualaikum my name syukri i'm 23 years old. I'm marketing degree student of UiTM Kelantan campus Kota Bharu. I'm now in semester 3. I live in Machang Kelantan and i always commute from uitm kb before but now due to covid-19 pendemic. I am studying online. because of this, I can save on travel costs and more organized time.</p> 

	<p>I'm founder of "Cendawan ajaib", so i want to share some knowledge about mushroom variety.</p>

	<p>Mushrooms come in lots of different shapes, sizes, and colors. The ones that aren’t toxic happen to be quite healthy, and tasty too.</p>

	<p>For many years they’ve been used for their unique ability to add flavor in lots of different cultures’ cuisines. Although they’re actually fungi, mushrooms are lumped in the vegetable category for cooking purposes. Mushrooms allow you to add extra taste without sodium or fat.</p>

	<p>Poisonous mushrooms can be hard to identify in the wild, so you should always buy from a reliable grocery store or market. The most common types found in grocery stores are:</p>

	<p>shiitake, portobello, crimini, button or white mushroom, oyster, enoki, beech, maitake. They each have a unique look and taste.</p>

	<p>When choosing your mushrooms, make sure they feel firm, aren’t moist to the touch, and are mold-free. They can be stored in a paper bag inside the fridge for about five days. Brush the dirt off and rinse them lightly when you’re ready to use them.</p>
